# vucket [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/v0lture/vucket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/v0lture/vucket)
A bucket of various APIs used across v0lture projects

## Requirements
PHP: `7.0` due to `random_int` being used in this project, it will **not** work with PHP versions pre7.0.

MySQL: `5.6`, however other versions will most likely work but is only tested with `5.6`.
