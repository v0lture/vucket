# This software is not complete and is currently missing major features
It is not recommended to be used whatsoever outside of v0lture, but if you wish to help us in the development progress beware of broken/missing features and want to give us feedback.

## Requirements
PHP: `7.0` with package `php-curl` installed.

MySQL: `5.6`, however other versions will most likely work.
